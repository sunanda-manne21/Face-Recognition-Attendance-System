🧠 Project Title: Face Recognition-Based Attendance System
📋 Description:

This project is an automated attendance management system that uses face recognition technology to identify and record students’ attendance. It eliminates the need for manual attendance marking and ensures accuracy, security, and time efficiency.

The system captures facial images of students through a camera, trains the model using OpenCV and LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm, and recognizes faces in real time to mark attendance automatically. Each attendance session generates a separate CSV file with student details, date, and timestamp.

🚀 Key Features:

📸 Real-time face detection and recognition using OpenCV.

💾 Automatic CSV generation for each attendance session (no overwriting of previous data).

🧍‍♂️ Student registration with ID and name.

🕒 Automatic timestamp logging (date & time).

⚙️ Tkinter GUI for a user-friendly interface.

🔔 (Optional) Integration for sending SMS notifications when attendance is marked.

🍓 Compatible with Raspberry Pi for portable and low-cost deployment.

🧰 Tech Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Pillow, Tkinter, CSV

Hardware (optional): Raspberry Pi, Camera Module

🎯 Use Case:

Ideal for schools, colleges, and workplaces to automate attendance tracking, prevent proxy attendance, and maintain digital attendance records efficiently.
